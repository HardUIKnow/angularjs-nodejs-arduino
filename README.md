# angularjs-nodejs-arduino
trying to make an user friendly fast web remote control

Please be aware to run :

1 - npm install (to get all node module installed)
2 - bower install (to get bower module installed)
3 - Move bower component folder to public folder (need to fix this on index html)
4 - Use standard firmata on arduino board (tested on uno)

schematic is coming but it is as follow:

led connected on pin (9,10,11,12)
pot connected on analog 0

main app is server.js

todo:

simplify code maybe with ng-model 
simplify code in server to get and parse result from/to all client

Any comment are welcome please contact me on
